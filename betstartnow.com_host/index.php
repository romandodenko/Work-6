                Betting is an old entertainment of people from ancient times. In ancient Greece, spectators bet on the
                outcome of the Olympic Games, in ancient Rome - on the victory of gladiators and charioteers. Of course,
                at that time there were no bookmakers and the best sports betting sites, but this did not stop people
                from betting directly with each other.

              <p class="hero__text tx-1">
                Bookmakers appeared in the UK. In 1790, William Ogden began taking bets on horse racing. He pre-set the
                ratio between the size of the bet and the winnings for each horse. In 1850, Leviathan Davis and Fred
                Swindell opened the first bookmaker's office. The news about the existence of the office spread quickly
                around the city, leaflets with chances of winning were distributed everywhere. And the founders
                themselves made the predictions.

                Many years have passed, and the business of betting companies has developed and spread to different
                cities and countries: America, France, Germany and Russia. The work was carried out according to the
                same rules as now: they found disputers and guaranteed payments to the winners, and in return they took
                a margin - profit from bets.

              Many authorities were against betting and various gambling, so until the middle of the 20th century,
              bookmaking remained illegal in Europe and the USA. Bookmakers survived thanks to corruption or loopholes
              in the law. Bettors could only rely on the honesty of the bookmaker. In the mid-20th century, sports
              betting became more popular as it became legal in some states. In 1961, the authorities of Great Britain,
              France, Germany and some US states legalized betting. Within 6 months after the legalization of betting
              activities in the UK, 10,000 bookmakers opened. In 1949, Nevada legalized sports betting and remained the
              only state where it was legal until 2018, when the Supreme Court overturned a federal law banning betting
              outside of Nevada. The work of bookmakers was now regulated: the players were protected by law, and the
              bookmakers themselves “came out of the shadows”.
            </p>
            <p class="block__text tx-1">
              1961 became famous for the fact that the British Government completely legalized and regulated bookmaking.
              The legislator forbade the gambling establishment and players to use any advantages. Games could take
              place only in special clubs.
            </p>

              Today, sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry with millions of people betting on everything
              from football and basketball to horse racing and golf. The rise of online sports betting has made it more
              accessible than ever and continues to grow in popularity around the world.
