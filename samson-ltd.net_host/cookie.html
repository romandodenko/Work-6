            to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or
            not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

          <h2><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h2>

          <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for
            how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other

            features of the this site.</p>

          <h2><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></h2>

          <ul>


            <li>
              <p>Login related cookies</p>
              <p>We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having
                to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when
                you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.</p>
            </li>

          </ul>
